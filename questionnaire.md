## ETL Architecture Project Questionnaire

### Project Data Points
1. Across all reservation partners for January & February, how many completed reservations occurred?

2. Which studio has the highest rate of reservation abandonement (did not cancel but did not check-in)?

3. Which fitness area (i.e., tag) has the highest number of completed reservations for February

4. How many members completed at least 1 reservation and had no more than 1 canceled reservation in January?

### Project Discussion
1. Describe what custom logic you chose to implement in your ETL solution and why?

2. What forecasting opportunities do you see with a dataset like this and why?

3. What other data would you propose we gather to make reporting/forecasting more robust and why?

4. What was difficult and how might you have approached that obstacle differently next time?
